class Augmenter:
    """
    A collection of dataset augmentation methods including transformations, 
    blurring, resizing, and brightness adjustments. 

    NOTE: This class is used to transform data necessary for training TechTrack's models.
          Imagine that the output of `self.transform()` is fed directly to train the model.
    
    The following transformations are included:
    - Horizontal flipping: i.e., def horizontal_flip(**kwargs)
    - Gaussian blurring: i.e., def gaussian_blur_image(**kwargs)
    - Resizing: i.e., def resize(**kwargs)
    - Brightness and contrast adjustments: i.e., def change_brightness(**kwargs)
        - HINT: you may use cv2.addWeighted()

    Note: These methods uses **kwargs to accept arbitrary keyword arguments,
    but explicit parameter definitions improve clarity and usability.
    - "**kwargs" reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/args-kwargs-python/

    Finally, Provide a demonstration and visualizations of these methods in `notebooks/augmentation.ipynb`.
    You will define your own keywords for "**kwargs".
