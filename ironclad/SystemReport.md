### [INSERT ANALYSIS 1 TITLE]
- How are you studying the design decision (e.g., metrics used, experimental setup, etc.)?
- Summarize your results using graphs, tables, etc.
- Draw an unambigious conclusion to your system design.
    - For example: "Because our results show ..., we recommend to design the system ..."
